# What are Granular Certificates?

Granular Certificates (GCs) are the **next evolution of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)**, designed to track **clean energy generation at an hourly or sub-hourly level**. Unlike traditional RECs, which typically account for renewable electricity on an **annual or monthly basis**, GCs provide **precise time, location, and environmental impact data** for every unit of renewable energy produced. This advancement enables **24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching, improved carbon accounting, and greater transparency in clean energy procurement**.

## **Why Granular Certificates Matter**

As corporations, utilities, and grid operators transition to **24/7 CFE commitments**, the need for **hourly-matched clean energy tracking** is rapidly increasing. Granular Certificates:

* **Enable true 24/7 carbon-free energy claims** by ensuring clean energy is matched with real-time consumption.
* **Support corporate sustainability goals** by improving **Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions reporting** under the GHG Protocol.
* **Facilitate energy storage monetization**, allowing batteries to issue GCs for time-shifted renewable energy.
* **Enhance regulatory compliance** with emerging policies that require **sub-hourly tracking of clean energy procurement** (e.g., EU’s RED III and SEC climate disclosure rules).
* **Unlock new revenue streams for renewable generators** by allowing them to sell premium, time-matched energy attributes in high-demand periods.

## **The Role of The Granular Registry**

The **Granular Registry** is the **infrastructure that enables the issuance, trading, and retirement of GCs**, ensuring **market interoperability, data integrity, and transparent transactions**. By integrating **with existing REC registries**, The Granular Registry provides a **seamless transition for energy buyers and producers** looking to adopt **high-resolution energy tracking** and **monetize time-based clean energy attributes**.

With Granular Certificates, the clean energy industry is moving beyond static RECs toward a **more dynamic, verifiable, and impactful approach** to **renewable energy procurement**.
