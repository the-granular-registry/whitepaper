# How are GCs Issued?

Creating PECs involves a detailed process that ensures accuracy and reliability in representing the environmental impact of clean energy generation.

This process can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Collection of Hourly Meter Data:** The process begins with collecting hourly meter data from the CFE generator. This data provides precise information about the amount of clean energy produced at specific times, enabling accurate tracking and certification.
2. **Retire Issued EACs in Local Registry:** EACs are issued by the grid operatorâ€™s EAC issuer based on the energy generated. The issued EACs are transferred to the PEC registry account in the local EAC registry, ensuring no double-counting. PEC users can claim the attributes of the underlying EACs.
3. **Publish Project Impact Report:** All project attributes are collected in a report published with the issued PECs.
4. **Apply the Hourly Timestamps:** Each PEC is assigned hourly timestamps using the generation meter data. Time-based granular certificates enable hourly matching, providing flexibility for 24/7 PPAs and corporate portfolio management.
5. **Assign Marginal Carbon Impact:** The emissions data selection process selects a data source based on the generator's location. The grid's historical marginal emissions factor at the specific time of generation is assigned to the PECs.
