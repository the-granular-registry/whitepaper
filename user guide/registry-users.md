# Registry Users

There are three main types of registry users:

**Company Representatives (CR)**

The company representative is a user with the administrative role of setting up their company on the registry, creating and managing the company's accounts, and inviting other users to serve roles for those accounts.

**Account Representative (AR)**

An account representative is a user that performs the day-to-day operations on SAF certificates held by registry accounts. ARs are invited to join accounts by a CR working for the same company.

A CR can also serve as an AR for one or more accounts.

**Registry Administrator (RA)**

The registry administrator is a 'superuser' on the registry charged with overseeing all aspects of the registry to ensure the smooth operation of the platform.
