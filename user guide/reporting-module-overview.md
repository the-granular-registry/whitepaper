# Reporting Module Overview

The Reporting Module is a neutral, data-centric toolset that enhances transparency and usability without extending into interpretive services of carbon accounting and consumption matching. This preserves the Registry's core role as a compliance-grade ledger for Granular Certificates (GCs).  Reports are exportable (PDF/CSV/Excel/JSON), auditable (with tamper-evident trails), and filterable (by time, location, account), aligning with standards like EnergyTag, EU RED III, and SEC disclosures.

The module includes six core reports, segmented by user roles (REC procurement, sustainability, compliance). These leverage GC attributes to deliver verifiable insights, enabling ecosystem partners to integrate via APIs for custom workflows.

## **GC Inventory and Transaction Summary**&#x20;

* REC Desk: Portfolio tracking
* Aggregates GC holdings by timestamp (peak/off-peak), location (bidding zones), and emissions impact; logs lifecycle events (issuances, trades, transfers, retirements) with volumes and timestamps.
* Analyzes trends, including average impact per MWh, expiration risks, and historical patterns, and flags anomalies for audit.
* Supports procurement forecasting; API endpoints for integration with external trading/matching tools.

## **Hourly GC Attribute Breakdown**&#x20;

* REC Desk: Data for optimization
* Visualizes GC distributions by hour, location (e.g., GPS or grid zones), and carbon factors (avoided emissions via long-run MERs); heatmaps highlight temporal coverage gaps.
* Provides statistics: total GC volumes, attribute summaries (e.g., percentage in high-impact hours), and raw exports for load profile alignment in third-party matchers.
* Enables scenario prep: Filterable datasets for external what-if analyses on CFE coverage.

## **Avoided Emissions and Impact Metrics Report**

* Sustainability: ESG data export
* Computes aggregated avoided tCO2e from retired GCs using embedded long-run MERs; segments by timestamp, location, and organizational accounts.
* Analyzes benchmarks: Vs. grid averages, trends over time, and per-GC impact scores; includes retirement proofs for Scope 2 verification.
* Formats for disclosures (e.g., CDP/SEC templates); APIs supply data to external tools for emissions-matching claims.

## **24/7 CFE Attribute Summary**&#x20;

* Sustainability: Progress tracking prep
* Summarizes GC retirements by hour/day/month/year, with attribute overlays (e.g., % in peaks, location matches); calendar views for temporal patterns.
  * Provides aggregates: Fleet-wide volumes, per-account details (e.g., storage time-shifts), and raw GC data for external CFE calculators.
    * Supports storytelling: Exportable visuals and benchmarks vs. annual EACs; neutral datasets for third-party 24/7 claims.

## **Lifecycle Audit Trail Report**&#x20;

* Compliance: Verification logs
* Chronological records of GC events (issuance to retirement), with full attributes (IDs, timestamps, impacts) and EAC linkages; public retirement table cross-checks.
  * Analyzes integrity: Double-counting flags, retirement rates, and anomaly summaries; tamper-evident logs for auditors.
  * Enables regulatory prep: Searchable exports with digital signatures; APIs for integration with external verifiers.

## **Compliance Attribute Alignment Summary**

* Compliance: Standard mapping
* Maps GC data to frameworks (e.g., GHG Protocol Scope 2, EnergyTag configs); breakdowns by attributes with evidence (e.g., sub-hourly proofs).
* Analyzes adherence: % compliant GCs, risk assessments (e.g., expiration overlaps), and organizational aggregates.
* Generates templates: Pre-formatted for EU RED III/SEC; neutral exports for third-party claim validation.
