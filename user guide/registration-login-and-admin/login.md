# Login

After you have registered your company and it has been approved by the registry administrator, you may log in to the registry using any of three options:

1. Entering your email address
2. Google (Gmail) account
3. Microsoft account

## 2-Factor Authentication

The next step in the process is to secure your account using your preferred [2-factor authenticator app](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-authenticator-apps). Open your 2-factor authenticator app and scan the QR code that is presented to you.

You will need to open your authenticator app each time you log in to submit the new 6 digit code. Note: these codes expire every 60 seconds
