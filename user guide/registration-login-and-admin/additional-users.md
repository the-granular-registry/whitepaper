# Additional Users

Additional company representatives can be added to a company once the company is successfully registered. To do so, go to the "company information" section and clicking "add company representative".

You can add an existing user (already registered on the platform), or you can send an email invitation to someone not yet registered.

Each new company representative added to a company will need to go through the [KYC process](user-identification.md).
