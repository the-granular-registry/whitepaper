# Removing your company and all accounts from the Registry

At any time, a Company Representative may begin the process of removing their company and closing all of their accounts on the registry by navigating to the Company Overview window, clicking the three dot menu to the right of the company details panel, and selecting "Close company"

This will begin the company offboarding process, which includes an alert to the Registry Admin (to ensure it wasn't initiated by accident). Once the offboarding is confirmed, all accounts without active units will be closed. Any account that has active (i.e., not retired) PECs cannot be closed until those PECs are resolved (i.e., retired, transferred to another account, etc).
