# Registration, Login, and Admin

Each company on the Registry has one or more **company representatives** (CR) that administer the company's users and accounts on the Registry. You must designate an initial company representative when you initially register your company. It is possible to change the company representative or add more company representatives after initial registration is complete.

The following pages describe the steps in more detail.

You must be associated with a company to use the Registry (that is, a natural person cannot sign up to use the Registry without association with a legally recognizable company)
