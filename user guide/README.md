# Overview

### Introduction

* **Purpose of the Guide**: This guide provides detailed instructions for using the Granular Registry, a cloud-native platform designed to issue, track, and retire Granular Certificates (GCs) for hourly or sub-hourly energy attribute tracking. It supports transparent 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) accounting and impact-based carbon reporting for renewable energy markets.

## **Audience**

* **Corporate Energy Buyers**: Corporations, utilities, and hydrogen producers seeking precise Scope 2 emissions reporting.
* **Renewable Energy Producers**: Wind, solar, geothermal, bioenergy, nuclear, and marine/tidal project operators.
* **Storage Operators**: Battery and energy storage system operators managing time-shifted renewable energy.
* **Utilities and Suppliers**: Entities offering standard supply service (SSS) or green tariffs.
* **Existing EAC Registries**: Operators of REC, GO, or I-REC systems transitioning to hourly tracking.
* **Auditors and Verifiers**: Professionals ensuring compliance with GHG Protocol and regulatory standards.
* **Overview of Granular Certificates (GCs)**: GCs are advanced energy attribute certificates that track renewable or carbon-free energy generation at an hourly or sub-hourly level, embedding long-run marginal emissions rates (MERs). Unlike traditional Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), which use annual or monthly aggregates, GCs provide precise time, location, and emissions impact data, enabling 24/7 CFE matching and enhanced carbon accounting.

## **Key Benefits**

* **Transparency**: Public retirement tables and audit trails prevent double-counting and ensure verifiable claims.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Aligns with EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), U.S. SEC climate disclosure rules, and state-level policies (e.g., California, New York).
* **Impact-Based Accounting**: Supports Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions reporting under the GHG Protocol by embedding marginal emissions data.
* **Market Innovation**: Enables premium pricing for high-impact energy and new revenue streams for storage operators.
* **Granular Registry Overview**: Operated by Clean Incentive, the registry integrates with existing EAC systems, supports EnergyTag Standard compliance, and offers modular deployment (direct install, third-party hosted, or global SaaS). It provides open APIs for interoperability and optional attribute modules (e.g., health, community, wildlife impacts).
