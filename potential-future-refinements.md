# Potential Future Refinements

## Energy Storage

A separate document will develop a methodology for issuing PECs for energy storage assets with net carbon impact.

## Other Carbon-Free Generation

A key part of addressing carbon impact globally is recognizing the emissions reduction contributions of all carbon-free generation sources. As we – the global _we_ – continue to innovate to realize and integrate new technologies onto our grid, we must also create the foundation for their environmental attributes to be easily measured, analyzed, certified, and compared against the other forms of carbon-free generation. The robustness and flexibility of the PEC methodology provide that foundation, ensuring all technologies are evaluated under the same rigorous methodology.

Nuclear energy is a continuous supply of zero-carbon electricity, making it a vital component of a diversified grid looking to increase its clean energy supply. The nuclear energy industry has historically struggled to monetize its environmental attributes through the traditional EAC standards. However, PECs acknowledge the significant contributions to emissions reductions that the nuclear industry provides and provide a framework for these projects to monetize those attributes.

Geothermal, concentrated solar power (CSP), tidal and wave energy, hydro, and more can be evaluated using the PEC methodology based on their specific spatial and temporal data. If electricity can be generated using carbon-free technologies, it can be measured, analyzed, and certified based on its unique characteristics.

## &#x20;Embedded Emissions

Calculate the embodied emissions associated with a project’s production, construction, and installation to report each project’s emissions impact accurately.
