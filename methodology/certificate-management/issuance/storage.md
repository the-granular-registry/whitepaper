## Process for Creating PECs <a href="#heading-h.3fqxosmq6xnn" id="heading-h.3fqxosmq6xnn"></a>

The process for creating PECs involves the following steps:

1. For the audit period, the data is collected and analyzed to create the project impact report as described in the [reporting section](https://app.gitbook.com/o/T49SBN1HvvV7wKIQcGSo/s/B3tcjQIEErb6Nqt143QY/~/changes/28/methodology/project-reporting/storage) of the methodology. &#x20;
2. If a project has net avoided emissions, one PEC is issued for every one MWh of discharged energy, and the total avoided emissions are distributed equally across all PECs issued.
3. The PECs issued can be purchased manually or traded through automated contract transactions in the PEC marketplace.
