## Process for Creating PECs <a href="#heading-h.3fqxosmq6xnn" id="heading-h.3fqxosmq6xnn"></a>

The process for creating PECs involves the following steps:

1. For the audit period, the data is collected and analyzed to create the project impact report. &#x20;
2. Once the report is complete, the issued RECs are transferred from the project operator to the PEC Registry omnibus account in the corresponding REC registry.&#x20;
3. The PEC Registry generates PECs for each REC issued and assigns avoided emissions according to the published methodology. &#x20;
4. The PECs issued can be purchased manually or traded through automated contract transactions in the PEC marketplace.
