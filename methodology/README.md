## Role and Operation of the Registry <a href="#heading-h.u51bf86x5cd6" id="heading-h.u51bf86x5cd6"></a>

The PEC Registry serves as the central platform for the creation, registration, transfer, and retirement of PECs. It provides a transparent and reliable system for tracking PECs from their generation to their final retirement. The registry is operated by Clean Incentive and is designed to ensure the integrity and credibility of the PECs.

The PEC Registry operates as follows:

1. **Creation:** PECs are created in the registry once a third-party verifier has verified them.
2. **Registration:** PECs are registered in the registry under the name of the project operator who generated them.
3. **Transfer:** PECs can be transferred between registered users of the registry. All transfers are recorded in the registry to ensure traceability.
4. **Retirement:** PECs are retired in the registry once they have been used to claim the associated environmental attributes. Once retired, PECs cannot be transferred or used again.&#x20;

### Process for Registering, Transferring, and Retiring PECs <a href="#heading-h.15478245udwi" id="heading-h.15478245udwi"></a>

The PEC Registry is designed to ensure the integrity and credibility of the PECs. It provides a transparent and reliable system for tracking PECs from their generation to their final retirement.

1. **Registration:** To register PECs, the project operator must submit the necessary data and the verification report to Clean Incentive. Once the PECs have been verified, they are registered in the registry under the name of the project operator.
2. **Transfer:** To transfer PECs, the holder of the PECs must initiate a transfer request in the registry. The recipient of the PECs must accept the transfer for it to be completed. All transfers are recorded in the registry.
3. **Retirement:** To retire PECs, the holder of the PECs must initiate a retirement request in the registry. Once the request has been approved, the PECs are retired and cannot be transferred or used again.

## Integration with Existing Systems <a href="#toc153689848" id="toc153689848"></a>

The PECs registry is designed to integrate with existing renewable energy certificate systems and regulatory frameworks. It aims to complement and enhance current market mechanisms for trading renewable energy attributes, ensuring interoperability and seamless transition for market participants.

## Jurisdictional Considerations <a href="#toc153689849" id="toc153689849"></a>

While the registry operates on a global platform, it recognizes and adheres to regional and national regulatory requirements. The framework is adaptable to accommodate the diverse legal and regulatory landscapes of different countries and regions.

## Limitations and Exclusions <a href="#toc153689850" id="toc153689850"></a>

This governance framework does not extend to:

* **Direct Regulation of Renewable Energy Projects:** The registry does not directly regulate the development and operation of renewable energy projects but focuses on the certification and trading of their environmental attributes.
* **Non-PEC Transactions:** Transactions and activities outside the scope of PECs issuance, trading, and retirement fall outside the purview of this registry.

## Amendments and Revisions <a href="#toc153689851" id="toc153689851"></a>

The governance framework is subject to periodic reviews and amendments to adapt to evolving market dynamics, technological advancements, and stakeholder needs. Such revisions will be undertaken following the established decision-making protocols, ensuring continuous alignment with the objectives of transparency, efficiency, and stakeholder engagement.
