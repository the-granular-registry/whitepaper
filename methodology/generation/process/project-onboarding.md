# Project Onboarding

The Granular Certificates (GC) methodology establishes clear guidelines for project eligibility, ensuring that a broad spectrum of carbon-free energy (CFE) generation sources can participate in the GC registry. The primary goal of this methodology is to promote the development and use of renewable and low-carbon energy technologies that significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, facilitating a global transition to a more sustainable energy system.

## **Criteria for Eligible Projects**

Eligible projects must meet specific criteria to ensure that they align with the GRF’s goals of transparency, accuracy, and impact in emissions reduction. These criteria are designed to cover various energy sources, technologies, and project configurations that deliver measurable carbon reductions.

The types of projects eligible for inclusion under this methodology include, but are not limited to, the following:

### **1. Wind Energy**

Wind power projects, both onshore and offshore, are eligible for GCs. Wind energy is recognized as one of the most mature and widely adopted renewable technologies. Eligible wind projects must demonstrate compliance with local regulatory requirements, provide hourly generation data, and ensure that the associated Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are retired in accordance with GC registry rules. Projects should also incorporate measures for minimizing environmental and social impacts, such as wildlife conservation efforts and community engagement.

### **2. Solar Energy**

Solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) projects are key contributors to global renewable energy deployment. Eligible solar projects must adhere to GC methodology standards by providing accurate data on energy generation, geographic location, and any potential grid curtailment issues. These projects must also ensure that all RECs or Guarantees of Origin (GOs) associated with solar energy generation are properly retired. Solar projects integrated with energy storage solutions are also eligible and can enhance grid reliability by offering dispatchable clean energy.

### **3. Hydropower**

Hydropower projects, including both large-scale and small-scale installations, are eligible under the GC standard. However, special considerations are given to environmental and social factors, such as ecosystem impact, water resource management, and community displacement risks. Projects must demonstrate compliance with environmental best practices and regulations to ensure that their contributions to emissions reduction are sustainable. Run-of-the-river projects, pumped storage hydropower, and hybrid systems (e.g., combined with solar or wind) are also eligible, provided they meet the GC data submission and transparency requirements.

### **4. Geothermal Energy**

Geothermal energy projects that tap into the Earth’s heat for power generation or heating are eligible for GC issuance. These projects must provide data on their specific location, generation capacity, and operational characteristics, as well as the marginal emissions impact of displacing more carbon-intensive generation on the grid. Geothermal energy is particularly valuable for providing consistent, baseload clean energy. Projects must also adhere to environmental regulations regarding water use, land impacts, and emissions of non-condensable gases such as hydrogen sulfide.

### **5. Bioenergy**

Bioenergy projects, including those that utilize biomass, biogas, and waste-to-energy technologies, are eligible for GCs if they comply with sustainability criteria. Projects must ensure that feedstock sourcing is sustainable and that net carbon emissions are reduced through lifecycle accounting. This includes demonstrating that bioenergy does not contribute to deforestation, land degradation, or significant biodiversity loss. The GC registry will require detailed information about the carbon content of the feedstock, emissions during combustion, and any associated carbon capture or offset mechanisms in place. Bioenergy projects should also provide data on emissions avoided compared to the fossil fuel alternatives displaced by their energy generation.

### **6. Nuclear Energy**

Nuclear energy projects that generate power without direct carbon emissions are eligible for inclusion in the GC framework. Given the low-carbon nature of nuclear energy, such projects provide significant emissions reduction benefits, particularly in regions with high reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear projects must ensure compliance with strict safety, waste management, and decommissioning standards. They must also provide accurate generation data, which the GC registry will use to calculate the associated marginal carbon impact.

### **Additional Project Categories**

While the above categories represent the primary eligible CFE sources, the GC methodology is designed to be flexible, allowing for the inclusion of emerging technologies and configurations that support decarbonization efforts. Other eligible projects may include:

* **Hybrid Projects**: Energy systems that combine multiple CFE technologies, such as solar-plus-storage, wind-solar hybrids, or solar-geothermal projects. These systems can optimize energy delivery while maximizing emissions reductions.
* **Energy Storage Integrated with CFE**: Projects incorporating battery energy storage or other forms of energy storage alongside renewable energy generation. These projects help shift the supply of renewable energy to periods of higher demand, thereby maximizing the avoided emissions impact of CFE. Storage systems must adhere to GC guidelines on neutralizing charging emissions, ensuring that stored energy remains carbon-neutral.
* **Marine and Tidal Energy**: Emerging marine energy technologies that harness energy from ocean currents, tidal flows, and waves may also be eligible for GCs. These projects must provide data on their energy generation, environmental impact, and grid integration potential.

## **Data and Reporting Requirements**

All eligible projects must adhere to the following reporting requirements to ensure their generation data is accurately reflected in the GC system:

1. **Hourly Generation Data**: Projects must submit hourly meter data, ensuring that energy generation is tracked with high temporal granularity. This is crucial for calculating the carbon impact of the energy generated at specific times.
2. **Geographic Location**: Accurate locational data must be provided for all projects to ensure proper calculation of marginal emissions reductions based on the specific grid and its carbon intensity.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Projects must demonstrate compliance with all relevant local, regional, and national regulations related to environmental protection, emissions reporting, and renewable energy certification.
4. **Transparency and Verification**: Project data will be subject to independent third-party audits to verify its accuracy and adherence to the GC methodology. This ensures that issued GCs reflect actual emissions reductions.

## **Conclusion**

The broad scope of eligible carbon-free energy projects under the GC methodology encourages innovation in renewable energy development while maintaining rigorous standards for data transparency and environmental stewardship. By encompassing a wide range of technologies, from wind and solar to advanced bioenergy and nuclear, the GC registry aims to support the decarbonization of energy systems worldwide and provide stakeholders with the tools to measure and report emissions reductions accurately.
