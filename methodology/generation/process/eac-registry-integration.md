# EAC Registry Integration

The Granular Registry is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing EAC registries to enhance carbon accounting transparency and improve the operational efficiency of renewable energy procurement. This integration is essential for ensuring that environmental attributes associated with carbon-free energy (CFE) generation are accurately represented without double-counting. GCs provide additional value through enhanced data on carbon emissions reductions.

## **Configuration 1: Enhance Existing PPAs**

In this configuration, GCs are issued based on already retired EACs in the end user's EAC registry account. This approach is ideal for companies or organizations that have entered into operational Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Since the RECs have already retired, the environmental attributes associated with renewable energy have been claimed. GCs can then be issued without modifying or interacting further with the EAC registry.

GCs will be registered in the Granular Registry under the same end user, providing additional data layers for emissions tracking, such as the marginal emissions reductions achieved by the associated renewable energy project. This configuration maintains simplicity, avoiding operational risks or complexities by ensuring that REC management processes remain unchanged while still allowing for advanced carbon accounting capabilities.

Key Benefits:

* **Minimal Complexity**: No changes to the REC registry are required.
* **Risk Reduction**: Since no further transfers or retirements occur in the REC registry, this method avoids operational risks.
* **Operational PPA Fit**: This approach suits organizations that are already retiring RECs under existing PPAs.
* **Transparency and Data Enhancement**: The GC registry adds emissions data without complicating REC transactions.

## **Configuration 2: Enhance Unbundled RECs**

This second configuration involves transferring active RECs from a local REC registry to the GC Registry trading account. Once the RECs are moved, they are either canceled or retired within the GC registry, allowing GCs to be issued. This configuration is particularly suitable for organizations purchasing unbundled RECs, as it enables the environmental attributes of the RECs to be integrated directly into the GC registry and claimed by the end user.

This approach offers comprehensive tracking and transparency by managing both REC retirement and GC issuance within the GC registry. It ensures that the environmental claims related to energy are clearly linked to specific emissions reductions. After GC issuance, the end user can claim the environmental attributes of both the REC and the associated emissions reductions, reflecting the gridâ€™s carbon intensity at the time and place of energy generation.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Comprehensive Emissions Tracking**: Allows for enhanced transparency by tracking both REC and GC attributes within the GC registry.
* **Ideal for Unbundled RECs**: Ensures the environmental attributes of unbundled RECs are transferred, retired, and tracked within a single system.
* **Imported RECs**: RECs effectively become part of the GC registry, enabling users to claim energy and emissions attributes.
* **Enhanced Corporate Carbon Accounting**: This tool enables companies to more precisely align energy procurement with emissions reduction goals, supporting advanced carbon accounting strategies such as 24/7 matching.

Both configurations enhance renewable energy procurement through the GC registry by offering flexibility, transparency, and advanced carbon tracking capabilities. These integrations ensure organizations can adopt GCs without disrupting their existing REC strategies while gaining access to more precise carbon accounting data to meet sustainability objectives.
