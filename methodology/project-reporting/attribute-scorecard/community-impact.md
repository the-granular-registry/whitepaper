# Community Impact

By integrating these social impact considerations into the PEC issuance process, the certificates could represent not just the carbon impact of renewable energy projects, but also their broader social value. This would make PECs a more holistic measure of renewable energy's benefits and make them more attractive to companies with strong social responsibility commitments.

1. **Community Impact Assessment:** PECs could be issued with an additional assessment of the project's impact on local communities. This could include factors like job creation, local economic stimulation, and improvements in local infrastructure. Projects demonstrating a high community impact could increase the social score or a special designation.
2. **Social Justice Fund Contributions:** A portion of the revenue from PEC transactions could be directed towards a social justice fund. This fund could support initiatives promoting social equity and justice in communities affected by climate change or energy production.
3. **Inclusive Project Development:** Projects demonstrating inclusivity in their development, such as involving local communities in decision-making processes or ensuring fair labor practices, could increase the social score. This would incentivize project developers to consider social impact in their operations.
4. **Environmental Justice Considerations:** Projects located in or benefit communities disproportionately affected by environmental pollution or climate change could increase the social score. This would help to address environmental justice issues and promote equitable access to clean energy.
5. **Education and Capacity Building:** Projects that include an element of education or capacity building, such as training programs for renewable energy jobs or educational programs about climate change and sustainability, could increase the social score.

## Automated Community Impact Funding

Automating payments to community-impact NGOs from the sale of PECs can be a powerful tool for companies to meet their social and environmental justice goals. Here's how:

1. **Direct Impact:** By linking the sale of PECs to automatic contributions to NGOs, companies can ensure that their renewable energy procurement has a direct and measurable impact on communities. This could involve supporting NGOs that work on issues like poverty alleviation, education, health, or environmental conservation in areas affected by renewable energy projects.
2. **Transparency and Accountability:** Automation of payments can increase transparency and accountability. Stakeholders can easily track the flow of funds from the sale of PECs to the supported NGOs. This transparency can enhance the credibility of a company's social impact efforts and build stakeholder trust.
3. **Efficiency:** Automated payments can streamline the process of contributing to NGOs. It reduces administrative burdens and ensures that funds reach the intended NGOs promptly, allowing them to put the funds to use more quickly.
4. **Alignment with Sustainability Goals:** By supporting NGOs that align with their sustainability and social responsibility goals, companies can ensure that their renewable energy procurement contributes to a holistic sustainability strategy. This can enhance the company's reputation and strengthen its social and environmental justice commitment.
5. **Engagement and Empowerment:** This approach can also empower local communities by directing funds to NGOs that work directly with these communities. It can also engage employees and customers by showing the tangible impacts of the company's renewable energy procurement.

In summary, automating payments to community impact NGOs from the sale of PECs can provide a direct, transparent, and efficient way for companies to enhance the social impact of their renewable energy procurement and contribute to their broader sustainability and social justice goals.
