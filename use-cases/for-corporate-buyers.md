## Enabling Impact-Based Carbon Accounting

The emissions associated with purchased electricity are accounted into the Scope 2 category according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which sets the internationally recognized carbon accounting guidelines. The framework establishes two approaches to account for emissions from grid electricity use, the location-based, in which electricity usage data is multiplied by a factor representing the average emissions from electricity generated in that region or country, and the market-based, which reflects the emissions associated with contractual information relating to the source and attributes of electricity supply. Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) are included under this last approach.

Lately, a change to the protocol has been called for. The main problem with current Scope 2 accounting is that it needs to consider that location and time matter when accounting for the use of electricity and the consequent emissions. Based on this, a new approach based on emissions impact is promoted in the new version of the protocol.

The impact-based carbon accounting new approach uses Locational Marginal Emissions (LME) rates to determine induced emissions for load and avoided emissions for renewable generation to understand how overall system emissions change through actions.

## Demand-side Management

Demand-side Management is a key aspect of the PEC framework. It highlights how calculating induced emissions can create financial incentives for businesses to manage their energy consumption in ways that reduce their carbon footprint.

Induced emissions refer to the emissions that are caused by a particular activity or process. In the context of electricity consumption, induced emissions are the emissions that are caused by the generation of electricity that a business consumes. These emissions can vary significantly depending on the time of day and the location of the electricity generation.

By calculating induced emissions, businesses can understand the carbon impact of their electricity consumption. This can provide a strong financial incentive to shift their electricity consumption to times of day when emissions are lower. For example, in regions where a significant proportion of electricity is generated from renewable sources, emissions can be lower during times of high renewable generation, such as during the day for solar power.

Similarly, calculating induced emissions can incentivize businesses to locate or expand their facilities in regions of the grid where more renewable energy is available. By doing so, they can reduce the carbon impact of their electricity consumption and therefore reduce the number of PECs they need to purchase to achieve carbon-neutral operations.

The financial value of these actions can be directly quantified by the cost of the PECs that the business would otherwise need to purchase. This can give businesses a clear return on investment, making it easier to justify the cost of implementing energy efficiency measures or relocating their operations.

In addition to reducing a business's carbon footprint, these demand-side management strategies can also have other benefits.

1. **Load Shifting:** Moving electricity consumption to times of lower demand can reduce strain on the grid. Lower electricity prices during these times could result in cost savings.
2. **Facility Relocation:** locating facilities in regions with low emissions can help to support renewable energy where it is produced. This reduces the need for transmission line upgrades and battery storage.

In essence, demand-side management highlights how the PEC framework can provide clear financial incentives for businesses to manage their energy consumption in ways that reduce their carbon footprint. This can help to drive the transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy.
