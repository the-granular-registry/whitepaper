# For Utilities

## New "Impact Tariffs"

Utility green tariffs represent a significant opportunity for applying PECs. Green tariffs are programs offered by utilities that allow customers to source a portion or all of their electricity from renewable sources. These programs have traditionally been based on the purchase and retirement of RECs but introducing PECs can add a new level of granularity and accuracy to these programs.

Utilities like corporate customers are increasingly focused on reducing carbon emissions. However, utilities face unique challenges and opportunities in this regard. Unlike corporate customers, utilities have direct control over generating and distributing electricity and are responsible for serving all customers in their service territory. This means utilities must balance the need for reliable, affordable electricity to reduce carbon emissions.

PECs can play a crucial role in this balancing act. By providing a quantifiable measure of the carbon emissions avoided by each megawatt-hour of renewable energy, PECs can help utilities track and report their carbon reductions more accurately. This can be particularly valuable for utilities that offer green tariff programs, as it allows them to demonstrate the actual carbon impact of these programs to their customers.

For example, a utility could offer a green tariff based on PECs, where customers pay a premium to source their electricity from renewable projects that generate PECs. The utility could then retire these PECs on behalf of the customer, effectively reducing the customer's carbon footprint. This approach provides a clear and quantifiable measure of the carbon impact of the green tariff, which can enhance customer satisfaction and trust in the program.

Furthermore, utilities can use PECs to optimize their renewable energy procurement and grid operations. By focusing on projects that generate high volumes of PECs, utilities can maximize the carbon impact of their renewable energy investments. This can help utilities to meet their own sustainability goals, as well as regulatory requirements for renewable energy and carbon reduction.

### Developing High-Impact Green Tariff Products with PECs

1. **Market Analysis and Product Design:**
   * **Identify High-Impact Opportunities:** The utility begins by analyzing the grid's current energy mix, particularly focusing on regions with high coal use or high carbon intensity. Projects in these areas are likely to have a higher impact in terms of emissions avoided per MWh generated.
   * **Product Design:** Based on this analysis, the utility designs a green tariff product that specifically sources PECs from high-impact projects. The product is tailored for customers looking to go beyond the minimum of annual energy matching, offering them the opportunity to directly support the transition away from high-carbon sources.
2. **Premium Pricing for High-Impact PECs:**
   * **Pricing Structure:** The utility decides to pay a premium for PECs associated with high-impact projects. This premium reflects the additional environmental value of displacing coal or other high-carbon energy sources on the grid.
   * **Incentivizing Development:** By offering to pay more for these PECs, the utility creates a strong financial incentive for developers to build renewable energy projects in regions where they can have the most significant emissions reduction impact.
3. **Marketplace Participation:**
   * **Buying High-Impact PECs:** The utility actively participates in the PEC marketplace, purchasing PECs that meet its criteria for high impact. This might involve direct agreements with project developers or bidding in PEC auctions.
   * **Transparency and Traceability:** Utilizing the PEC registry's capabilities, the utility ensures the transparency and traceability of the PECs it purchases, verifying the emissions avoided and the location and timing of the renewable generation.
4. **Customer Engagement and Marketing:**
   * **Targeted Marketing:** The utility markets its high-impact green tariff product to environmentally conscious customers, emphasizing the direct correlation between their support and the displacement of coal or high-carbon energy sources.
   * **Reporting and Certification:** Customers are provided with detailed reports on the specific impact of their participation in the green tariff program, including the quantity of emissions avoided. This information can be critical for customers' sustainability reporting and branding.
5. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement:**
   * **Impact Assessment:** The utility regularly assesses the impact of its green tariff program, analyzing the reduction in carbon emissions achieved.
   * **Adjustments and Expansion:** Based on the program's success and customer feedback, the utility adjusts its strategy, possibly expanding its focus areas or increasing its premium for high-impact PECs to further incentivize renewable development in key regions.

## Carbon-Free Energy as a Service (CFEaaS)

The concept of a Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) management service is a novel approach to corporate procurement of renewable energy. This approach is based on the principle of avoided emissions rather than energy matching, and it can be significantly enhanced by using Power Emissions Certificates (PECs).

Google's CFE Manager framework provides a useful model for understanding how this can work in practice. The CFE Manager model is a new type of retail electricity supply agreement optimized to deliver clean power when and where needed to decarbonize a grid userâ€™s electricity demand. Instead of purchasing as-produced clean energy from a specific generation asset to match annual electricity consumption, the CFE Manager model builds a portfolio of resources tailored to match hourly electricity demand.

The integration of PECs into this model can provide several benefits. Firstly, PECs can provide a more accurate and verifiable measure of the emissions avoided through renewable energy sources. This can help ensure that the CFE Manager meets its decarbonization targets and provide a more robust basis for carbon accounting.

Secondly, PECs can provide a flexible mechanism for adjusting the balance of the energy portfolio to meet changing demand patterns. For example, if a corporate customer's induced emissions increase, they can purchase additional PECs to ensure their net emissions remain neutral.

Thirdly, PECs can provide a transparent and standardized measure of the environmental and social value of the renewable energy sources in the portfolio. This can help to enhance the credibility and reputation of the CFE Manager and its corporate customers.

In the context of Google's CFE Manager framework, PECs could be used to certify the carbon-free energy purchases at an hourly level. This would provide a more granular and accurate measure of the decarbonization impact of the CFE Manager model. It could also help to incentivize the development of new clean energy projects and the extension of the lives of existing clean energy assets.

In conclusion, the integration of PECs into the CFE Manager model for corporate procurement of renewable energy can provide a more accurate, flexible, and credible approach to achieving decarbonization targets. It can also help drive the development and deployment of new clean energy projects, accelerating the transition to a carbon-free energy future.

Using PECs to facilitate these transactions has multiple benefits:

1. **Accurate Carbon Accounting:** PECs provide a more accurate and verifiable measure of the actual emissions avoided through the use of renewable energy sources. This can help ensure that the CFE Manager meets its decarbonization targets and provide a more robust basis for carbon accounting.
2. **Flexibility:** PECs offer a flexible mechanism for adjusting the balance of the energy portfolio to meet changing demand patterns. If a corporate customer's induced emissions increase, they can purchase additional PECs to ensure their net emissions remain neutral.
3. **Transparency and Standardization:** PECs provide a transparent and standardized measure of the environmental and social value of the renewable energy sources in the portfolio. This can enhance the credibility and reputation of the CFE Manager and its corporate customers.
4. **Incentive for Clean Energy Development:** The use of PECs can incentivize the development of new clean energy projects and the extension of the lives of existing clean energy assets. This can accelerate the transition to a carbon-free energy future.
5. **Granular Measurement:** PECs certify the carbon-free energy purchases hourly. This would provide a more granular and accurate measure of the decarbonization impact of the CFE Manager model.
6. **Risk Management:** By separating the environmental attributes from the energy component, PECs can help manage the risk associated with fluctuating energy prices and changes in energy demand.
7. **Market Liquidity:** PECs can be traded independently of the energy component, potentially creating a more liquid market for the environmental attributes of renewable energy.
8. **Enhanced ESG Reporting:** The use of PECs can enhance a company's ESG reporting by providing verifiable evidence of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to the transition to a carbon-free energy future.
