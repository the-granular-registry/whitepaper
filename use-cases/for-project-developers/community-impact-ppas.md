# Community Impact PPAs

Community or Social Impact PPAs are a unique application of Power Emissions Certificates (PECs) that can significantly contribute to local development and social equity. These PPAs are designed to reduce carbon emissions and create positive social and economic impacts within the communities where the renewable energy projects are located.

In this context, PECs serve as a powerful tool to document and quantify the unique attributes of a project's development or construction phase. This includes local job creation, community engagement, infrastructure development, and other socio-economic benefits often overlooked in traditional renewable energy procurement.

When a renewable energy project is developed under a Community or Social Impact PPA, a comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report is created. This report provides a detailed account of the project's social and environmental impacts and is directly linked to the PECs issued for the project. This ensures complete transparency and traceability, allowing stakeholders to verify the positive impacts associated with their PEC purchases.

Moreover, the PEC platform can be configured to automatically allocate a portion of the proceeds from PEC sales to a non-profit organization or Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) of choice. This feature provides a direct financial contribution to community development and social initiatives, further enhancing the social impact of these PPAs.

Community or Social Impact PPAs, facilitated by PECs, provide a holistic approach to renewable energy procurement. They address the environmental aspect of renewable energy and ensure that the social and economic benefits are maximized, documented, and directly linked to the renewable energy produced. This approach aligns with the growing emphasis on ESG factors in corporate sustainability strategies and provides a comprehensive solution to meet these objectives.
