# Utility Battery Storage

Battery storage systems are becoming increasingly important in the energy landscape, providing valuable services such as load shifting, frequency regulation, and backup power. For utilities, these systems can also play a crucial role in managing the variability of renewable energy and supporting grid reliability. PECs can provide a new way to quantify and monetize these carbon benefits.

Operating a battery storage system can induce and avoid emissions, depending on when and how it is charged and discharged. When a battery is charged, it induces emissions by increasing the electricity demand. The amount of emissions induced depends on the carbon intensity of the grid at the time of charging. Conversely, when a battery is discharged, it can avoid emissions by reducing the need for electricity from fossil fuel sources. The amount of emissions avoided depends on the carbon intensity of the grid at the time of discharging.

By tracking the operation of the battery system and the carbon intensity of the grid, it is possible to calculate the net emissions impact of the system and generate PECs accordingly. This can provide a new revenue stream for battery storage systems, incentivizing operators to optimize the dispatch of their operations for carbon abatement.

### Stand-Alone Storage <a href="#toc140235278" id="toc140235278"></a>

Stand-alone storage systems, which are not directly coupled with renewable energy generation, face limitations regarding REC generation. Since RECs are tied to renewable energy generation, stand-alone storage systems do not inherently produce RECs. However, with the introduction of PECs, these systems can now participate in the carbon market. By charging during high renewable generation and low carbon intensity periods and discharging during high carbon intensity periods, stand-alone storage systems can generate PECs, creating a new revenue stream and incentivizing carbon-conscious operations.
