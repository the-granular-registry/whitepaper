# Green Hydrogen Production

## Introduction

Hydrogen is emerging as a critical solution for decarbonizing sectors of the economy that are difficult to electrify, such as heavy industry and long-distance transport. However, the carbon impact of hydrogen production depends heavily on the source of energy used. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, has the potential to be a genuinely zero-emissions fuel. PECs can provide a robust and transparent way to ensure that hydrogen production is green. The additionality score of the PECs can be used very useful.

Using marginal emissions rates can help in accurately assessing the carbon intensity of hydrogen produced through grid electricity. The approach of calculating marginal emissions rates on a temporal and spatial basis offers several benefits over the current methods of annual average method or 24/7 hourly matching approach.

This method is more in line with the actual emissions impact of utilizing grid electricity for hydrogen production. Furthermore, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) should only decrease the carbon footprint of hydrogen production if they genuinely prevent emissions based on the PEC methodology. This ensures that the emissions calculations are based on real emissions reductions and not just theoretical ones.

The production of green hydrogen involves the electrolysis of water, a process that consumes electricity. The carbon emissions induced by this process depend on the carbon intensity of the electricity used. By tracking the electrolyzer's operation and the grid's carbon intensity, it is possible to calculate the induced emissions of hydrogen production.

To ensure that hydrogen production is green, it is necessary to match the induced emissions with an equivalent amount of avoided emissions. This can be achieved by purchasing and retiring PECs. The PECs provide a quantifiable and verifiable measure of the avoided emissions, ensuring that the net emissions impact of hydrogen production is zero.

This approach allows green hydrogen facilities to be located where an offtaker for the molecules is available rather than being tied to specific renewable energy projects. Also, the facility can run with high uptime or reduce consumption during periods of high carbon intensity. This can provide greater flexibility and efficiency in the siting and operation of green hydrogen facilities.

Furthermore, this approach can enable the creation of Hydrogen Emissions Certificates, providing a robust and transparent way to certify the carbon impact of the hydrogen. Each certificate is linked to a specific batch of hydrogen, with traceability to the induced emissions report and the retired PECs used in carbon-matching. This would provide a high level of transparency and confidence for offtakers and regulators, helping drive the green hydrogen market.

In summary, PECs can provide a powerful tool for ensuring the green credentials of hydrogen production, enabling flexible and efficient siting of facilities, and creating a robust and transparent certification scheme.



## Key benefits of using PECs:

1. **Accurate Carbon Matching**: Enables precise documentation of emissions reductions.
2. **Strategic Facility Siting**: Allows siting near offtakers, reducing logistics costs.
3. **High Equipment Uptime**: Ensures efficient operation and better ROI.
4. **Blockchain Verification**: Provides transparent "proof-of-emissions" certification.
5. **Supply Chain Transparency**: Enhances trust and accountability in green hydrogen claims.
6. **Market Incentives**: Encourages development of high-impact projects by providing a financial premium for PECs.
7. **Simplified Distribution**: Lowers the need for extensive transport infrastructure by enabling production closer to consumption points.
8. **Enhanced Project Financing**: Reduces investment risks through reliable emissions documentation, facilitating more green hydrogen projects.
