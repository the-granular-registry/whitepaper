# Multi-Asset PPAs

In corporate procurement, the concept of a Portfolio PPA is gaining traction. A Portfolio PPA allows a corporate buyer to contract with a developer for a mix of renewable energy assets, such as wind, solar, and battery storage, rather than a single project. This approach offers several advantages, including diversification of resource types and geographical locations, which can lead to a more consistent and reliable renewable energy supply.

The integration of battery storage into a Portfolio PPA is particularly noteworthy. Battery storage can store excess renewable energy generated during periods of high production (e.g., midday for solar) and discharge it during periods of high demand or low renewable production (e.g., evening for solar). This ability to shift renewable energy supply to match demand patterns can significantly increase the effective use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based peaking power plants.

However, even with a diversified portfolio of renewable assets, there may be times when the renewable energy generated does not fully match the corporate buyer's electricity consumption in terms of volume and timing. This is where Power Emissions Certificates (PECs) come into play.

In the context of a Portfolio PPA, a corporate buyer can purchase supplemental PECs to fill any gaps between their actual electricity consumption and the renewable energy supplied by the Portfolio PPA. This provides a flexible mechanism to ensure that the corporate buyer's net emissions remain neutral, even when the renewable energy supply from the Portfolio PPA does not perfectly match their consumption.

Furthermore, PECs can be integrated into the corporate buyer's carbon accounting framework, providing a transparent and verifiable way to demonstrate their commitment to renewable energy and carbon neutrality. This can enhance their sustainability credentials and contribute to their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals.

Flexibility: PECs provide flexibility in structuring a Portfolio PPA. They allow for the inclusion of multiple renewable energy assets. They can fill any gaps in renewable energy supply, ensuring that the corporate buyer's net emissions remain neutral.

Using PECs to facilitate these transactions has multiple benefits:

1. **Risk Mitigation:** By diversifying the renewable energy assets in a Portfolio PPA and supplementing with PECs, corporate buyers can mitigate the risks associated with reliance on a single type of renewable energy or a single project.
2. **Transparency and Verifiability:** PECs provide a transparent and verifiable way to demonstrate renewable energy generation's environmental and social value. This can enhance corporate buyers' sustainability credentials and contribute to their ESG goals.
3. **Market Liquidity:** PECs can be traded independently of physical electricity, contributing to the liquidity of the renewable energy market. This can facilitate more efficient pricing and risk management.
4. **Carbon Accounting:** PECs can be integrated into a corporate buyer's carbon accounting framework, providing a clear and consistent method for tracking and reporting on their carbon emissions and reductions.
5. **Incentive for Renewable Development:** The potential to generate PECs can provide an additional financial incentive for developing renewable energy projects, particularly in locations that can displace high carbon emissions.
6. **Community Impact:** PECs can also capture the social value of renewable energy projects, such as community benefits or job creation. This can help corporate buyers meet their broader sustainability and social responsibility goals.
7. **Simplicity:** By separating the environmental and social value from the physical electricity, PECs can simplify the contractual arrangements in a Portfolio PPA, making it easier for corporate buyers to understand and manage.

## Hybrid

Hybrid storage systems, which are directly coupled with renewable energy generation, can similarly benefit from PECs. While these systems can generate RECs from their renewable energy generation, adding PECs provides an additional revenue stream and further incentivizes optimal operation for carbon abatement.

## Virtual Hybrid

Furthermore, PECs can enable the creation of "virtual hybrid" PPAs. In this arrangement, a renewable energy project and a battery storage system are contracted together even though they are not located together. The combined system can generate PECs based on the net emissions impact of both the renewable generation and the battery operation. This can provide a more accurate measure of the carbon impact of the combined system and create a more substantial financial incentive for the deployment of battery storage with renewable energy.
