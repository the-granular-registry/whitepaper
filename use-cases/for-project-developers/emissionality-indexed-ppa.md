# Emissionality-Indexed PPA

### Corporate Procurement <a href="#toc140235271" id="toc140235271"></a>

In corporate renewable energy procurement, PECs offer a unique and powerful tool for companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and achieve sustainability goals. This is particularly relevant for companies with significant energy loads, such as data centers, manufacturing facilities, and large commercial buildings, where the induced emissions from energy consumption can be substantial.

Traditionally, companies have purchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset their energy consumption and demonstrate their commitment to renewable energy. However, RECs alone do not provide a measure of the actual carbon emissions avoided by renewable energy generation. This is where PECs come into play.

In corporate renewable energy procurement, Power Emissions Certificates (PECs) introduces a novel approach to structuring PPAs. This approach called an Emissionality Indexed PPA, allows for a more accurate reflection of renewable energy generation's environmental and social value.

In an Emissionality Indexed PPA, the agreement is divided into two components:

* **Brown Power Price:** Based on the project's baseline energy production and LCOE.
* **Attribute Price:** A separate agreement for the environmental and social value encapsulated in the PECs. This can include a carbon price for avoided emissions.

On the other hand, the environmental and social value is quantified in terms of the volume of avoided emissions, which the PECs represent. This value can be purchased in a separate agreement within the PPA, effectively decoupling the environmental and social benefits from the energy price. This agreement can include a price per ton of carbon, providing a clear and quantifiable measure of the environmental value of the renewable energy project.

The transaction for the PECs is processed using the PEC registry. This registry tracks the creation, transfer, and retirement of PECs, ensuring transparency and accountability in the transaction. The owner of the retired PECs can then incorporate the avoided emissions into their carbon accounting framework, providing a robust and verifiable measure of their carbon reduction efforts.

This approach to structuring PPAs provides several benefits. It allows for a more accurate reflection of the true value of renewable energy, considering not only the energy produced but also the environmental and social benefits. It also provides a clear and quantifiable measure of the carbon reduction impact of the renewable energy project, enhancing the credibility and transparency of corporate sustainability efforts. Furthermore, decoupling the energy price from the environmental and social value provides greater flexibility in structuring the PPA, potentially making renewable energy projects more financially viable and attractive to corporate buyers.

Using PECs to facilitate these transactions has multiple benefits:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity:** Using PECs to transact renewable energy projects' environmental and social value simplifies the process and makes it more transparent. The value of each PEC is clearly defined, making it easier for buyers to understand what they are purchasing.
2. **Flexibility:** PECs can be bought and sold independently of the power itself, providing greater flexibility for buyers and sellers. This allows for more dynamic and responsive transactions adapting to changing market conditions.
3. **Market Liquidity:** By creating a separate market for environmental and social value, PECs can increase market liquidity. This facilitates more transactions and leads to more accurate price discovery.
4. **Risk Management:** Separating the environmental and social value from the power price can help to manage risk. If the value of these attributes fluctuates, it won't directly impact the price of the power.
5. **Standardization:** PECs provide a standardized environmental and social value measure. This can make comparing different projects easier and make more informed decisions.
6. **Transparency and Verification:** PECs can be tracked and verified, ensuring that the environmental and social benefits claimed by a project are real and have been independently validated.
7. **Incentivization:** By monetizing renewable energy projects' environmental and social value, PECs can provide a financial incentive for more sustainable practices.
8. **Easier Integration into Carbon Accounting:** PECs provide a clear and quantifiable measure of avoided emissions, which can be easily incorporated into a company's carbon accounting framework.
9. **Accessibility:** By breaking down the environmental and social value into discrete units (PECs), smaller buyers who may not be able to engage in large PPAs can still participate in the market and contribute to renewable energy projects.
10. **Scalability:** The PEC model can be easily scaled up or down, making it suitable for many projects, from small local initiatives to large-scale industrial operations.
