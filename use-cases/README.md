# Use Cases

This document provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications of PECs, a groundbreaking tool in the realm of renewable energy procurement and carbon accounting.

PECs represent a significant innovation in the way we quantify and trade the environmental benefits of renewable energy. By attaching a quantifiable measure of avoided carbon emissions to Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), PECs provide a more accurate reflection of the environmental impact of renewable energy generation. PECs allow for more precise carbon accounting and can incentivize renewable energy development in areas with the most significant impact on reducing grid emissions.

This guide aims to illustrate the versatility and potential of PECs through a series of use cases. These use cases span various sectors and applications, from corporate renewable energy procurement to green tariff programs, renewable energy project financing, carbon offsetting, green hydrogen production, community energy projects, and government renewable energy targets.

Each use case will provide a detailed description of the scenario, an example of how PECs could be applied, and the potential benefits of using PECs. The aim is to inspire and guide stakeholders in the renewable energy and carbon accounting sectors to explore the potential of PECs in their operations.

We invite you to delve into this guide and discover the transformative potential of PECs in driving the transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon energy future.

## Who are PECs intended for?

The PEC Standards & Guidelines are intended for a wide range of users, including:

1. **Renewable Energy Producers:** Producers can generate PECs from their renewable energy generation and sell them to consumers or other interested parties.
2. **Energy Consumers:** Consumers, including both businesses and individuals, can buy PECs to offset their energy consumption and demonstrate their commitment to renewable energy.
3. **Regulators and Policymakers:** Regulators and policymakers can use PECs to implement and monitor renewable energy policies and targets.
4. **Investors and Financiers:** Investors and financiers can use PECs to measure the environmental impact of their investments in renewable energy.
