# For Energy Producers

The transition to Granular Certificates (GCs) presents a new frontier of opportunities for renewable energy producers. By adopting hourly energy tracking, wind, solar, geothermal, and storage operators can unlock premium pricing, expanded buyer interest, and new revenue models in clean energy markets. The Granular Registry provides a trusted, standardized platform that enables energy producers to capitalize on real-time energy attribute tracking while enhancing the value of their generation assets.

## New Revenue Opportunities Through Hourly GC Markets

Traditional Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) operate on an annual or monthly basis, missing the true market value of clean energy at specific times when demand is high or when carbon-free energy supply is low. The Granular Registry enables producers to:

* Monetize renewable generation more effectively by issuing time-stamped GCs, allowing buyers to pay a premium for clean energy delivered at peak demand periods.
* Capture higher prices for energy sold during periods of low carbon-free energy supply, such as evening hours, winter months, or periods of high fossil fuel generation.
* Enable new market structures, including dynamic pricing for corporate buyers seeking 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) and utilities needing hourly renewable matching for compliance and consumer programs.

By certifying and time-stamping each unit of renewable energy, producers can sell clean electricity at a premium when and where it is most valuable, increasing overall project revenues.

## Increased Attractiveness for Corporate PPAs & Sustainability-Focused Buyers

As corporations move toward hourly energy tracking and 24/7 carbon-free energy commitments, traditional annual RECs are no longer sufficient to meet corporate sustainability goals. The Granular Registry makes renewable energy projects more attractive to corporate buyers by:

* Providing verifiable, hourly clean energy tracking, ensuring that companies can match their electricity use in real time with renewable energy production.
* Aligning with leading corporate energy initiatives, including Google’s 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, the UN’s 24/7 CFE Commitment, and the Emissions First Partnership.
* Expanding buyer demand, as sustainability-driven companies, data centers, and green hydrogen producers increasingly seek time-matched renewable energy sources.

By issuing hourly GCs, renewable energy projects can differentiate themselves from competitors and secure long-term corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) with companies committed to deep decarbonization.

## Enabling New PPA Structures & Green Tariff Opportunities

The introduction of GCs enables innovation in renewable energy contracting, allowing energy producers to offer more flexible and attractive clean energy products. The Granular Registry supports:

**1. Enhanced Corporate PPA Models**

* Hourly-matched PPAs where corporate buyers purchase time-stamped GCs to meet 24/7 energy goals.
* Hybrid PPAs that combine wind, solar, and battery storage, enabling time-shifting and firm renewable power delivery.
* Dynamic pricing PPAs, where GC value fluctuates based on supply and demand, increasing revenue potential for generators.

**2. Utility & Retail Green Tariffs**

* Enables utilities to offer customers premium renewable energy products, such as hourly green tariffs that precisely match clean energy supply with consumer demand.
* Supports retail electricity providers in certifying 24/7 clean energy offerings, creating new products for businesses and residential customers.

By adopting GC-based contracts, producers can secure higher-value long-term agreements, appeal to a broader range of corporate and utility buyers, and ensure greater revenue stability in volatile energy markets.

## Summary

The Granular Registry allows wind, solar, geothermal, and storage operators to monetize their energy production more effectively by enabling hourly tracking, premium pricing, and corporate-driven demand. With GC issuance, trading, and retirement, producers can unlock new revenue streams, secure long-term PPAs, and lead the transition toward a 24/7 carbon-free energy market.
