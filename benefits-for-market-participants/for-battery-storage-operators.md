# For Battery Storage Operators

As the energy market transitions toward 24/7 CFE, battery storage operators play a crucial role in ensuring renewable energy availability when and where it is needed most. The Granular Registry provides storage operators with the ability to issue Granular Certificates (GCs) for time-shifted renewable energy, enabling new revenue streams, optimized corporate procurement strategies, and enhanced grid flexibility.

## Enabling GC Issuance for Time-Shifted CFE to Increase Revenue Streams

Battery storage operators can issue GCs for energy that has been stored and later discharged, allowing them to monetize the time-shifting of renewable energy. This creates multiple financial benefits:

* Capturing premium pricing for GCs issued during high-demand, low-CFE hours, such as evening peaks or winter months when wind and solar generation is low.
* Reducing merchant exposure by enabling long-term forward contracts with corporate buyers seeking firm, time-matched clean energy.
* Creating new revenue streams by certifying and selling GCs for stored and discharged renewable energy, providing a verifiable mechanism for matching storage output with carbon-free generation.

By integrating storage tracking with GC issuance, battery operators can convert intermittent renewable generation into a reliable, marketable clean energy product with higher contract value and price stability.

## Enabling Close Coordination with Hourly Corporate Procurement or Load Profiles

Many corporations are now committed to 24/7 carbon-free energy, requiring them to match electricity consumption with renewable generation every hour of the day. Battery storage operators can use GCs to fill the gaps in corporate clean energy procurement strategies by:

* Delivering stored CFE exactly when needed to align with corporate load profiles and procurement contracts.
* Providing hourly-matched GCs to corporate buyers, ensuring that companies can meet their sustainability targets with verifiable clean energy.
* Optimizing revenue streams by selling time-shifted GCs at a premium to corporate buyers facing hourly shortfalls in their 24/7 CFE commitments.

This approach enables greater predictability in revenue generation, as corporate energy buyers increasingly seek firm, hourly-matched clean energy contracts.

## Enabling the Coupling of Storage with CFE Generators in a "Virtual-Hybrid" Configuration

Battery storage can be strategically paired with renewable energy projects in a "virtual-hybrid" configuration, allowing stored renewable energy to be shifted to hours of lower generation and higher demand. This enables:

* Shifting excess daytime solar energy to evening peak hours, ensuring clean energy availability when grid demand is highest.
* Balancing wind generation output, providing a consistent and firm renewable energy supply throughout the day.
* Optimizing GC issuance by tagging storage discharge events with the original clean energy attributes, ensuring accurate carbon accounting and verifiable 24/7 CFE claims.

For example, a solar-plus-storage project can store excess midday solar generation and discharge it during evening peak hours, maximizing GC value and enhancing the financial viability of renewable energy projects.

## Summary

Battery storage operators can leverage Granular Certificates (GCs) to enhance revenue streams, support corporate sustainability goals, and optimize the value of time-shifted clean energy. By integrating with The Granular Registry, storage assets can be fully monetized in 24/7 CFE markets, allowing operators to:

* Secure premium energy contracts for hourly-matched renewable energy.
* Reduce financial exposure to volatile wholesale market pricing.
* Enable better grid flexibility and decarbonization by shifting renewable energy to periods of high demand.

This unlocks new opportunities for storage operators, positioning them as key enablers of a fully decarbonized, 24/7 clean energy grid.
