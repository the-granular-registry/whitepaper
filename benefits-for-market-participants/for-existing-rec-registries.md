# For Existing REC Registries

Existing REC registries can seamlessly integrate GCs without disrupting their current operations. The Granular Registry offers a flexible, phased approach that allows registries to incrementally enhance their tracking capabilities, meeting the growing demand for hourly carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement while maintaining compatibility with traditional REC systems.

## Easily Enhance REC Registries Step by Step

The Granular Registry provides a modular, low-risk pathway for existing REC registries to add hourly tracking functionality without disrupting their core certificate issuance and retirement processes. Registries can choose from:

* **EnergyTag Configuration 3** – Start by issuing GCs for retired RECs, allowing market participants to claim hourly carbon-free energy (CFE) coverage without changing existing issuance structures.
* **EnergyTag Configuration 2** – Enable active GC issuance alongside RECs, allowing energy buyers to purchase hourly-matched clean energy attributes while maintaining compatibility with standard REC trading.
* **EnergyTag Configuration 1** – If desired, registries can fully transition to issuing hourly GCs instead of standard RECs, either by licensing The Granular Registry software for internal use or outsourcing GC operations to The Granular Registry.

This flexible approach ensures that each registry can choose the level of granularity that best fits their market needs, without requiring a full system overhaul.

## Does Not Increase Costs for Other REC Users

* Registries can offer Granular Certificates as an optional service for buyers and sellers interested in 24/7 carbon-free energy tracking, while keeping standard REC issuance unchanged for participants who do not require hourly data.
* This prevents cost increases for utilities, corporate buyers, and compliance-based programs that continue to rely on traditional REC structures.
* The Granular Registry is designed to complement existing REC markets, rather than replace them, ensuring a low-cost, low-risk adoption path.

## No Software Upgrades Required

* Seamless API integration allows REC registries to issue and track GCs without modifying their existing software infrastructure.
* Registries can use The Granular Registry as an external system to handle hourly data processing, GC issuance, and tracking, avoiding the need for costly IT development.
* Fully cloud-based architecture means that GC issuance scales effortlessly, without adding strain to existing registry platforms.

## No Need for PUC or Government Approval

* Since GCs operate as a voluntary market mechanism, registries can adopt them without requiring regulatory approval from public utility commissions (PUCs) or government agencies.
* GCs do not interfere with existing compliance-based REC markets, making it easy for registries to serve both voluntary and regulatory customers without policy conflicts.
* This regulatory flexibility allows registries to rapidly adapt to market demand while remaining aligned with local energy policies and disclosure programs.

## Additional Benefits for REC Registries

* **Attract New Market Participants** – By offering hourly GCs, registries can attract corporate buyers, utilities, and traders looking for high-precision energy tracking solutions.
* **Enhance Market Liquidity** – GCs enable more dynamic trading, as buyers can match clean energy procurement to specific time periods rather than relying on static, annual RECs.
* **Future-Proof REC Registries** – As regulatory standards evolve toward hourly carbon accounting (e.g., EU RED III, SEC climate disclosure rules), registries that support GCs will remain relevant and competitive.
* **Minimal Operational Overhead** – By partnering with The Granular Registry, existing REC registries can offer hourly tracking without hiring additional staff or making significant operational changes.
