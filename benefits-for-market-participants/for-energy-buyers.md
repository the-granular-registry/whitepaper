# For Energy Buyers

As corporations, utilities, and hydrogen producers accelerate their transition to clean energy, transparency, credibility, and regulatory compliance are becoming critical priorities. The Granular Registry provides GCs that enable real-time energy tracking, ensuring that renewable energy claims align with actual generation and consumption on an hourly basis.

## Enhanced Transparency in Clean Energy Procurement

Traditional RECs operate annually or monthly, making it difficult for buyers to precisely match their electricity consumption with renewable generation in real time. The Granular Registry provides:

* Hourly timestamped GCs that offer unmatched granularity and accuracy in tracking renewable energy procurement.
* Real-time data visibility, allowing corporate sustainability teams and utilities to align clean energy purchases with actual usage.
* Publicly verifiable certificate retirements, ensuring that no double counting occurs and that sustainability claims are backed by transparent tracking mechanisms.

For corporations with ambitious net-zero or 24/7 carbon-free energy goals, this level of transparency enables more effective energy procurement strategies and strengthens corporate sustainability reports.

## Verification of 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy and Impact Claims

Many corporations, data centers, and hydrogen producers are committing to 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) targets, requiring them to match their electricity consumption with renewable generation every hour of the day. The Granular Registry provides:

* Time-matched GCs, enabling buyers to verify that their electricity supply is truly clean at all hours rather than relying on annual averages.
* Advanced reporting tools that demonstrate compliance with Google’s 24/7 CFE initiative, the UN’s 24/7 Compact, and other emerging corporate sustainability standards.
* Seamless integration with corporate energy procurement platforms, allowing automated tracking and validation of hourly renewable energy purchases.

By leveraging time-based clean energy tracking, organizations can move beyond traditional REC-based claims and provide verifiable proof that they are running on 100% renewable energy every hour of every day.

## Improved Carbon Accounting Under Scope 2 & 3 Emissions Frameworks

Accurate carbon accounting is essential for regulatory reporting, sustainability disclosures, and financial decision-making. The Granular Registry enables:

* More precise Scope 2 carbon accounting, ensuring that electricity procurement is tracked with hourly energy attributes rather than relying on grid-average emissions factors.
* Scope 3 emissions tracking for energy-intensive supply chains, including clean hydrogen production, industrial decarbonization, and corporate carbon footprint reporting.
* Avoided emissions calculations, helping buyers measure the true environmental impact of their renewable energy investments and demonstrate real decarbonization progress.

For organizations reporting under GHG Protocol, CDP, or SEC climate disclosure regulations, using hourly GCs provides a more robust, defensible carbon accounting framework compared to traditional REC-based methods.

## Compliance with Emerging Regulatory Standards

As governments and regulators move toward stricter clean energy and emissions disclosure mandates, businesses need compliant, high-integrity tracking systems. The Granular Registry ensures:

* Alignment with EnergyTag standards, providing a recognized, standardized method for hourly renewable energy tracking.
* Compliance with upcoming EU, U.S., and international electricity tracking policies, including:
  * EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) requiring Guarantees of Origin (GOs) to support sub-hourly energy tracking.
  * SEC climate disclosure rules, which will require more transparent carbon accounting practices from publicly traded companies.
  * California and New York clean energy mandates, which are adopting higher granularity standards for renewable energy claims.
* Compatibility with grid operators and energy markets, ensuring that utilities and hydrogen producers can seamlessly integrate GC tracking into existing regulatory frameworks.

For energy buyers navigating evolving compliance landscapes, adopting GCs now prepares them for future regulatory requirements while ensuring credibility in sustainability reporting.
