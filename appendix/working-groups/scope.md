# Scope

The scope of the methodology development encompasses the following specific aspects of power emissions:

1. **Emission Sources Identification**: Defining and categorizing the various sources of power emissions, including but not limited to, fossil fuels, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, and other renewable sources.
2. **Emissions Calculation Standards**: Establishing standardized procedures for calculating emissions from different power sources, considering factors such as source efficiency, transmission losses, and geographical variations.
3. **Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and Offsets**: Integrating the role and impact of RECs and offsets in emissions calculations, ensuring that the methodology accommodates these factors effectively.
4. **Lifecycle Emissions Assessment**: Including a lifecycle assessment approach to account for emissions from the entire lifecycle of power sources, from extraction and production to transportation and usage.
5. **Sector-Specific Adaptations**: Adapting the methodology for application in various sectors, acknowledging the unique energy needs and emission profiles of industries such as manufacturing, technology, transport, and services.
6. **Data Collection and Management**: Defining protocols for data collection, management, and verification to ensure accuracy and reliability in emissions reporting.
7. **Alignment with International Standards**: Ensuring the methodology aligns with existing international standards and frameworks for environmental reporting and carbon emissions accounting.
8. **Certification and Verification Process**: Establishing a process for the certification and verification of emissions calculations to ensure credibility and uniformity in Power Emissions Certificates.
