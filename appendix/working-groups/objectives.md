# Objectives

The primary goals of the working group dedicated to developing a Power Emissions Certificate Methodology are as follows:

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Methodology**: To create a robust and universally applicable methodology for calculating and certifying power emissions. This methodology aims to set a standard that can be adopted by various projects across geographies and generation technologies.&#x20;
2. **Facilitate Transparency and Consistency**: To ensure that the methodology promotes transparency in reporting and consistency in the evaluation of power emissions across different geographical regions and energy sources.
3. **Support Sustainability Goals**: To contribute to global sustainability efforts by providing a tool that organizations can use to measure, report, and thereby reduce their carbon footprint.
4. **Promote Renewable Energy Use**: To incentivize the adoption of renewable energy sources by highlighting the lower emissions associated with these sources compared to fossil fuels.
5. **Enable Regulatory Compliance and Reporting**: To assist organizations in meeting regulatory requirements related to carbon emissions and environmental reporting, aligning with international standards such as the GHG Protocol, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
6. **Stakeholder Engagement and Education**: To engage with stakeholders across different sectors to gather input, ensure the methodology's relevance and applicability, and to educate them about the importance and use of the Power Emissions Certificate.
