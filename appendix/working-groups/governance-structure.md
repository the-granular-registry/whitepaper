# Governance Structure

The working group operates under a structured governance framework to ensure effective decision-making, accountability, and transparent operations. This governance structure is designed to facilitate collaboration among diverse stakeholders while maintaining a focus on our primary objective: the development of a robust power emissions certificate methodology.

1. **Leadership Team**: The working group is headed by a Leadership Team, comprising the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and Secretary. The Leadership Team is responsible for steering the group’s direction, ensuring adherence to the charter, and facilitating effective communication among members.
2. **Subcommittees**: For specialized tasks, subcommittees may be formed, each led by a designated Subcommittee Chair. These subcommittees work on specific aspects of the methodology development and report back to the main group.

## **Decision-Making Process**

1. **Consensus Approach**: The preferred decision-making method is through consensus. This approach fosters inclusive participation and collective agreement. Before any decision, an open discussion is encouraged to consider all viewpoints.
2. **Voting Protocol**: If consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made through a voting process. Each member organization will have one vote. Decisions require a majority (over 50%) to pass. In cases of significant decisions impacting the methodology’s core aspects, a higher threshold (e.g., two-thirds majority) may be applied.
3. **Role of the Chairperson**: The Chairperson facilitates decision-making processes, ensuring that each member has the opportunity to contribute to the discussion. In the event of a tie in votes, the Chairperson may cast the deciding vote.

## **Conflict Resolution**

1. **Initial Mediation**: In the event of a conflict or disagreement, the parties involved are encouraged to resolve the issue through direct, amicable discussions. The Secretary will facilitate these discussions, aiming for a mutually acceptable resolution.
2. **Escalation to Leadership Team**: If initial mediation does not resolve the conflict, the issue will be escalated to the Leadership Team. The Leadership Team will review the matter, gather input from all relevant parties, and propose a solution.
3. **Formal Voting**: Should the conflict persist beyond the Leadership Team’s intervention, a formal voting process will be invoked to resolve the matter, following the established voting protocol.
4. **Documentation of Disputes**: All conflicts and the steps taken to resolve them will be documented by the Secretary. This record will serve as a learning tool for future conflict resolution and ensure transparency in the group’s operations.
